## FOR PERSONAL USE, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! I'M AN AMATUER 
##I have since moved on from the screen and got a Raspberry Pi4 as of 09/10/24, so anything related to Sovol's screen will no longer be updated.

This repo will be used for personal use and "history" of my klipper experimenting, including the stock CFG & CONF files and more that came with my Sovol klipper screen and the "custom" versions of my own. I figured some of this can be put to good use, i can promise everything works on my end and i had no issues with any of these settings, i'm only uploading the best i've come up with. But if anything doesnt work for you, please let me know and i'll try to help!
